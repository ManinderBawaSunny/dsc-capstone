Our goal is to come up with three recommendations for the company Computing Vision in order to enter into the Movie Industry. Computing vision is a company that has seen the growth of companies creating video content and wanted to get in on the action however, they aren't sure of the best market entry strategy. We are going to define what success looks like in the movie indsutry but more specifically for this firm.\n"

    "\n",
    "Computing Vision (a made-up company for the purposes of this project) sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they don’t have much background in creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office using different samples of available data. You then will translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Computing Vision's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Business Questions: \n",
    "* What is success?\n",
    "    * How much the movie grosses from “The Numbers”\n",
    "    * The averaging rating / number of votes from IMDB database\n",
    "    * Total Profit and Gross Margin based on budget size\n",
    "* What do successful movies look like given our metrics\n",
    "* How does genre impact the success of a movie (Based on Financial Metrics?\n",
    "* Does director impact the rating and the net profitability?\n",
    "* What time of the year (month) is best to release a movie?\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Success?\n",
    "We will define success in two ways. The first being the Gross Margin and the other being Total Profit. The Gross Margin calculations are detailed below. The reason we chose to focus on profitabilty metrics instead of ratings was because this company, computing vision, is trying to break into a well established market they want to ensure that the investment they put in is having a positive return. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "Our recommendations for this company will be based off of the Gross Margin which is portrayed as a percentage. The higher this percentage is the more the company is retaining for every dollar that is invested in the movie and as such is seeing a higher return on their investment. This is not necessarily equivalent to a standard ratio of Gross Margin which would include Net Sales and COGS however, considering the \"Gross\" columns of our data frame as a proxy for sales, and Production Budget as a proxy for COGS will yield similar results and actionable outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "$Gross Margin = \\frac{Gross Revenue - Production Budget}{Gross Revenue} x 100$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an important metric, especially for a company about to enter an industry they have no presence in because it will help show how far their money goes to create profit. The higher this percentage the better the business will be doing because it is an indicator that retains more on each dollar of sales to its costs. This metric also allows us to take a standardized approach to comparing movies and their success. \n",
    "\n",
    "We want to investigate what a \"Good Movie\" i.e. a movie with a high Gross Margin is doing and try to emulate that. Thus we will explore the budget size, what directors are involved in those high margin films, and also what genres see the highest margin"

We will use this first to analyze the differnce in budgets, and recommend whether the company should target a large or small budget film. We are going to be taking a sample of 100 movies from the movie_budgets data frame to help with our analysis and visualizations. \n",

    "- only consider movies with a Gross value (worldwide, domestic, and foreign) greater than zero because you cannot calculate Gross Margin with 0 gross revenue\n",
    "- random samples from this data frame are representative of the population, and will be used in a independent two sample ttest\n",
    "- only consider within 1.5 times the IQR range on both sides to remove outliers\n",
    "- Do this independently for each of the categories domestic, foreign, and worldwide to get more accurate results\n",

    "Based on our research we found that there was a lot of \"gray area\" in the middle of small and large budget movies.

This allowed us to look at a more even amount of values in each category to get a better assessment of the bins we created.\n",

    "Creating a Budget Size categorical variable to be used for visualizing the gross margins will be crucial.
